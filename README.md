# genomicSIs

This repository contains code for estimating the serial interval distribution in case clusters using genomic data.

## File/folder contents:
* 'SI-from-clusters' contains all user-facing code and the R project file. A readme with full details of all scripts is included in this folder.
* 'SI with coprimary' contains utility functions for the underlying statistical model (with coprimary transmission).
* 'SI with noncoprimary' contains equivalent utilities for a model with no coprimary transmission.
 
 All code was prepared and tested under R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18). Package dependencies are listed and will be automatically installed in SI-from-clusters/set_up_analysis.R
